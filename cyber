                <p> It is the protection to defend internet connected devices from malicious attacks, hackers, spammers and cybercriminals It encompasses of strategies and measures put it in place to safeguard computers and networks but also invaluable data they store, defend against unauthorized access and threats lurking in the vast digital landscape The changing landscape of cybersecurity prevents ever-growing challenges for organizations worldwide. As we reach the 1990’s, many people started putting their personal information on the internet. Since people were doing this, it provided an opportunity for crime entities to steal that information and use that information as a source of income for them. This caused security threats to increase and firewalls and antivirus programmers, had to be put in place to protect the public. The early 2000’s crime companies started to spend a lot of funds on cyberattacks. Governments also started to give more serious sentences to those who are capable of hacking systems. From 2021 and onwards the cybersecurity industry will continue to grow at the speed of light. According to Statista, the global cybersecurity market size is predicted to increase to $345,4bn by the year 2026 :<a href="https://cybermagazine.com/cyber-security/history-cybersecurity" target="_blank">Learn more about Cybersecurity</a></p>

                <h3>Objectives of Cybersecurity Awareness</h3>
                <p>1. Phishing and Social Engineering:</strong> Teaching employees to recognize and avoid deceptive emails, messages, or websites designed to trick them into revealing sensitive information. Raising awareness about tactics cybercriminals use to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential data.</p>
                <p>2. Password Security:</strong> Educating employees on creating strong, unique passwords and the importance of regularly updating them. Promoting the use of MFA (multi-factor authentication) to enhance account security by requiring multiple forms of verification.</p>
                <p>3. Data Protection and the GDPR:</strong> Explaining the principles of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and its implications for handling personal data. Training on secure data handling practices, including encryption and data minimization.</p>
                <p>4. Mobile and Remote Security:</strong> Addressing security challenges related to smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices and providing guidelines for securing remote work environments.</p>
                <p>5. Reporting Incidents:</strong> Encouraging employees to promptly report suspicious activities or security incidents to appropriate channels.</p>
                <p>6. Safe Use of Social Media:</strong> Educating employees about the risks of social media usage, such as oversharing and social engineering attempts, and managing their digital footprint.</p>
                <p>7. Physical Security (Tailgating and Clear Desk):</strong> Teaching employees to prevent unauthorized physical access to facilities and promoting the importance of clearing desks of sensitive information to prevent data breaches.</p>
                <p>8. Data Classification:</strong> Explaining how to categorize data based on its sensitivity and the appropriate handling procedures for each classification.</p>
                <p>9. Supply Chain and Third-Party Risk:</strong> Understanding potential cybersecurity risks associated with third-party vendors and suppliers, and supplying targeted training to external partners to maintain security standards.</p>
